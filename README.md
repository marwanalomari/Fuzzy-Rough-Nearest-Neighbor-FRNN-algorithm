# Fuzzy-Rough-Nearest-Neighbor-FRNN-algorithm
This python program classifies text instances based on the lower and upper approximation of x to all the lables. This program developed based on Fuzzy Rough Nearest Neighbor (FRNN) algorithm described in the article: Jensen, R., &amp; Cornelis, C. (2011). Fuzzy-rough nearest neighbor classification and prediction. Theoretical Computer Science, 412(42), 5871-5884
This program runnable on a command:
(python)* FRNN.py datasetname.csv
*optional
The classification is based on 5 cross_validation
classification results evaluated using the following metrics:
1.acccuracy
2.root mean squared error (RMSE)

Note: the program is not perfectly coding the alogritms but it is a replicate of the implementation on the paper. This program is subject for further improvement.
